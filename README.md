####Credits

This Chrome extension would have never been possible without the amazing [Gmail.js](https://github.com/KartikTalwar/gmail.js) library! We also made use of the provided [Extension Boilerplate](https://github.com/KartikTalwar/gmail-chrome-extension-boilerplate) to get rolling.

The Microphone and Cog buttons are by [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/).

The extension icon is a combination of a speech bubble icon and an envelope icon, both made by [Yannick](http://yanlu.de) from [Flaticon](http://www.flaticon.com).

Last but not least, thanks to Google for Gmail, Chrome and their hosted speech recognition services!
